<h1>A brief introduction of the sims 4</h1>
    <p> The sims four is the latest version of the sims franchise and is technically better than all the rest. The Sims four has better graphics and is less laggy and buggy than its predisessors but it also doesn't have an open world like it used to, or a colour wheel for everything.</p> 
    <p>The sims four has four types of packs that you can buy, expansion pack which is the biggest and so has the most items in both build mode and cas it also usually has one world in each expansion pack. Game pack the second biggest, this has both cas and build buy stuff and occaisionaly worlds but is generally smaller than expansion packs. </p>

            <h2>Introduction of the Sims 4 community</h2>
            <p> The Sims 4 community has an estimate of 20 million unique players. Which is a massive community for people to be a part of. The Sims 4 community is made up of several different types of players. 
            <p>There are cas players, in which there are a lot of subsections. E.G custom content for cas mode, there are two types of custom content for the sims 4. Alpha and Maxis match, alpha is where it looks like real life and is isanely detailed and it includes a lot of different subsections like people who download only shoes or hairs. Maxis match is the cc that is trying to be as similar as possible to original sims 4 content. </p>
<p> There are builders who just play in build buy overview where they can make houses and interiors. There is also custom content for builders.</p>
            <p> Then there are the people who play in live mode. They play out storylines in which everyone can do their own thing.</p>
