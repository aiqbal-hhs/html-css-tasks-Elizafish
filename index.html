    <h2> The Idea of the Sims franchise</h2>
    <p>The sims was an idea that was made real. That idea was made because of sims city which was the first simulation game on the market. It was the first of its kind. Something that revoloutionised the gaming market. The first sims game was really different from anything on the market, it was a game where you could play out lives in the game. You could do anything you could be a criminal you could be a writer anything in real life you could be it in the sims, you could even be some fantasy things like fairies and mermaids in the later sims games. You could do so many things that were completely amazing back when it was first launched. Ever since the sims franchise first released it has been a hit</p>
