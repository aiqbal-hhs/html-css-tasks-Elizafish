<h1>Evolution of the Sims series</h1>
<p>If you could be anyone, who would you be? For two decades, the Sims franchise has answered this timeless question for hundreds of millions of players.
Every time you boot up The Sims, it’s akin to conducting a social experiment on virtual beings. You can build a character and a home from the ground up, form connections and shape generations. Or, you can burn it all down and wreak havoc. It’s a flexible form of play that has remained immensely popular for 20 years, despite a rapidly changing video game landscape. Through its four mainline games and expansions, the franchise recently hit 200 million copies sold on PC. Today, The Sims 4 has reached 20 million unique players worldwide.</p>
<p>The games in the Sims series are largely sandbox games, in that they lack any defined goals (except for some later expansion packs and console versions which introduced this gameplay style).
The player creates virtual people called "Sims," places them in houses, and helps direct their moods and satisfy their desires. Players can either place their Sims in pre-constructed homes or build them themselves.
Each successive expansion pack and game in the series augmented what the player could do with their Sims.
The Sims series is part of the larger Sim series, started by SimCity in 1989.</p>

<h2> The Idea of the Sims franchise</h2>
<p>Game designer Will Wright was inspired to create a "virtual doll house" after losing his home during the Oakland firestorm of 1991 and subsequently rebuilding his life. Replacing his home and his other possessions made him think about adapting that life experience into a game. When Wright initially took his ideas to the Maxis board of directors, they were skeptical and gave little support or financing for the game. The directors at Electronic Arts, which bought Maxis in 1997, were more receptive—SimCity had been a great success for them, and they foresaw the possibility of building a strong Sim franchise.</p>

<p>The Sims was the first game in the series. Developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts, it was released for Microsoft Windows on February 4, 2000.
The game used dimetric projection and featured open-ended simulation of the daily activities of one or more virtual persons ("Sims") in a suburban area near SimCity.
Seven expansion packs and two deluxe editions with exclusive content were released. It was repackaged in several different formats, and different versions of it were released on several different platforms. By March 22, 2002, The Sims had sold more than 6.3 million copies worldwide, surpassing Myst as the best-selling PC game in history at the time. The original game, all seven expansion packs, and the two deluxe edition content packs constitute the first generation of the PC. Maxis developed all PC releases.
By February 2005, the game had shipped 16 million copies worldwide. </p>
<p>Electronic Arts released The Sims 2 on September 14, 2004.
The sequel, developed by Maxis, takes place in a full 3D environment as opposed to the dimetric projection of the original game.
Sims age through seven life stages, from infancy to old age and subsequent death. Another major feature is the aspiration system.
Each Sim exhibits wants and fears according to its aspiration and personality.
Consequently, the level of the aspiration meter determines the effectiveness of a Sim at completing tasks.
The fulfillment of wants provides aspiration points, which can be used to purchase aspiration rewards.
The game also features clear days of the week, with weekends when children can stay home from school and vacation days when adults can take time off work.
The Sims 2 is set some 25 years after the original game. For instance, the Goth family has aged significantly with Bella Goth mysteriously vanishing ("dying") at some point in the 25 years
Because the entire game has progressed from 2D sprites to 3D models, all content in The Sims 2 had to be created from the ground up.
Due to this, The Sims 2 was not made backward-compatible with any content from the first generation of the main series.
However, some objects and features from the original series were remade for the sequel.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts released The Sims 3 on June 2, 2009.The sequel was announced by EA in November 2006.
The game is set 25 years before the original game and features an open, seamless neighborhood, improved Sim creation tools, enhanced build and buy mode functions, and the introduction of wishes and goals.
The game introduced a new form of directed gameplay through small, step-wise goals presented as opportunities for the player to pursue or refuse.
The Sims 3 sold 1.4 million copies in the first week, making it the largest release in PC gaming history at the time.
The Sims 3 is set 25 years before the Sims 1. For example, the Goth family is much younger, and Bella Goth, an adult in the first game, is a child and is named Bella Bachelor.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts announced The Sims 4 on May 6, 2013.[10] The announcement stated that the game was in development by Maxis.
The Sims 4 takes place in an alternative setting/timeline from the game's previous installment.
Later in 2014, further details on features and gameplay were announced. The release date of September 2, 2014, was announced at E3 2014.
As of March 2021, ten expansion packs, nine game packs and eighteen stuff packs have been released, and updates have added content that was previously absent due to time constraints.
Such as basements, ghosts, pools, modular stairs, toddlers, new careers, terrain tools and additional skintones,and bunk beds.</p>
